## Voting Power 

To vote on DAO proposals, the user must have voting power. Voting power is provided to holders of ATTICUS tokens and is gradually reduced as the staking or deposit approaches maturity. The voting power of each position depends on the number of lock-in days and the number of tokens staked. Meaning that a user who stakes 100 tokens for 3 months doesnâ€™t have the same voting power as a user who stakes 1000 tokens for 3 months. 
Max staking days is capped at 365 days, to avoid multi-year investments accruing too much power.
